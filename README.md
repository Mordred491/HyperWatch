## Installation

```bash
pip install hyperwatch
```

## Configuration

1. Copy the example configuration:
```bash
cp config/notification.yaml.example config/notification.yaml
```

2. Edit `config/notification.yaml` with your credentials:
```yaml
# Position Classification Thresholds
thresholds:
  notable_threshold: 1000        # $1K+ = NOTABLE
  medium_threshold: 10000        # $10K+ = MEDIUM
  large_threshold: 100000        # $100K+ = LARGE
  whale_threshold: 1000000       # $1M+ = WHALE

# Notification Channels
discord:
  webhook_url: "your_discord_webhook_here"

telegram:
  bot_token: "your_bot_token_here"
  chat_id: "your_chat_id_here"

email:
  smtp_server: "smtp.example.com"
  smtp_port: 587
  username: "your_email@example.com"
  password: "your_password_here"

webhooks:
  - url: "https://your-webhook-endpoint.com"


3. Configure coin mappings in `coin_mappings.json`:
```json
{
  "BTC": "bitcoin",
  "ETH": "ethereum",
  "SOL": "solana",
  "VIRTUAL": "virtual-protocol",
  "DOOD": "doodles",
  "PROMPT": "prompt"
}
```

4. Configure wallets to monitor in `hyperwatch/core/config.py`:
```python
WATCHED_WALLETS = [
    "0x1234abcd5678efgh",
]
```

## Usage

### Basic Monitoring
```python
from hyperwatch import HyperWatch

# Initialize monitor with configuration
monitor = HyperWatch(config_path="config/notification.yaml")

# Start monitoring
monitor.run()
